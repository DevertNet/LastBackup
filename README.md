# LastBackup
Imagine you are on vacation and all your luggage is stolen.
Do you know important phone numbers or bank details by heart? I don't know these things. 

That's why I created a backup solution where you can store important things with as little data as possible.

Why not use a normal cloud? I have protected most services with 2 factor authentication. If I lose my phone and laptop I can't access them anymore.

# IMPORTANT

I have build in a mail alert with a currently fixed mail address:
https://github.com/DevertNet/LastBackup/blob/master/src/api/Controller/Storage.php#L32

No password or URL is transmitted, only the hash.
As the tool is only used by me (so far), I have not made the e-mail address configurable. 

Feel free to write me an e-mail or create an issue if you want me to change it :)
